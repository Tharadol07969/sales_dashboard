## Data Preparation

### Loading & Cleaning Data
- Imported source tables into **Power BI Desktop**.  
- Removed duplicates, nulls, and obvious data errors.  
- Standardized data types (dates, numeric fields) and renamed columns for clarity.

### Dimension Date Table
- Created a dedicated **Date** dimension to leverage DAX timeâ€‘intelligence functions (e.g., YTD, YoY).  
- Ensured complete date coverageâ€”even on days without transactions.

### Data Model Relationships
- Established oneâ€‘toâ€‘many relationships between **Orders** and all dimension tables (Date, Products, Retailers).  
- Configured return flags and calculated profit measures for accurate aggregations.
